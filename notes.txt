define the move logic for each unique piece on piece_logic.js
    highlight the squares that the piece can move to
        rook - hihglight all the squares in a column and row (rook at c1 r1 highlight r1 and c1)
               ** repeats until c or r is at limit (8) or until blocked
        knight - (c+1, r+2), (c+2, r+1), 1st quadrant
               - (c+1, r-2), (c+2, r-1), 2nd quadrant
               - (c-1, r+2), (c-2, r+1), 3rd quadrant
               - (c-1, r-2), (c-2, r-1) 4th quadrant
        bishop - (c+1, r+1), top right
               - (c+1, r-1), bottom right
               - (c-1, r+1), top left
               - (c-1, r-1) bottom left
               ** repeats until c or r is at limit (8) or until blocked
        pawn - (r+1) or (r+2)
             - can only take enemies that are (c+1, r+1)-top right or (c-1, r+1)-top left
        king - (c, r+1) move up
             - (c, r-1) move down
             - (c+1, r) move right
             - (c-1, r) move left
             - (c+1, r+1) move top right
             - (c+1, r-1) move bottom right
             - (c-1, r+1) move top left
             - (c-1, r-1) move bottom right
        queen - implement rook + bishop + king
    get function to check if move is blocked
remove b_ or w_ for piece_logic.js
use selected_piece() to set the attribute for the piece using setAttribute() in js
